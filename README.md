## What is this?
I'm working on a little Discord bot to help my dragonboat team with our gym factions challenges.

This is how it works - members go to the gym, participate in challenges, or do any
kind of fitness activity and it grants the faction a certain amount of points.
The faction with the most points by the end of the season wins.

I've noticed that our captains can struggle with updating the points since they have to:
1. Go to the faction's discord channel
2. Individually review every single new post made since they've checked the channel
3. Manually enter the activity in Excel
4. Double check to make sure nothing's wrong

Furthermore, this is a daily effort that requires double-checking. This results in a lot of cognitive load and potential for mistakes.

By automating this, via a Discord bot, it would make the workflow much smoother for captains.
